					<h2><a name="general-comments">General Comments</a></h2>
					<p>
						I ended up purchasing the Oryx Pro 7 with base memory
						and storage, then replaced them with parts I bought from
						Amazon. The upgrade experience was pretty good. I had
						some trouble removing the back plate because some screws
						got stuck, but it was overall not too difficult. Coming
						from a desktop with a GTX 1070 and a 1440p 60 Hz
						monitor, I can honestly say that I prefer the higher
						refresh rate over the resolution bump. Gaming
						performance has been amazing, and my overall experience
						with the laptop has been positive. I will mention that I
						occasionally run into some freezing issues even when not
						doing anything particularly intensive, but these were
						largely resolved when I tried some different kernels.
						The fans did get too loud at times, but this was also
						resolved by switching kernels.

					<h2><a name="replacing-pop-os">Replacing Pop!_OS</a></h2>
					<p>
						Regarding OS, I initially tried to install Arch Linux
						with dwm like I had on my desktop, but found that
						switching between the graphics modes (i.e. Integrated,
						Hybrid, and Discrete) was just a nightmare. I tried
						installing System76 software through the AUR, but ran
						into too many issues that I couldn't resolve.
						Additionally, the laptop speakers did not seem to work
						either. Eventually got this working after trying the
						solution in ArchWiki. Thus, I decided to switch to
						Pop!_OS. The main change I made to the install process
						was to use btrfs rather than the default (ext4 I think)
						so I could take snapshots and backup my data with
						Timeshift. Overall, I'm really happy that System76 and
						Pop!_OS have come up with a good solution for switchable
						graphics. Being able to just click on the option in the
						GNOME menu is so useful. The window management in
						Pop!_OS is very good too. Coming from a standalone
						window manager like dwm, this provides a pretty good
						balance between convenience (having things work out of
						the box with a desktop environment) and usability
						(keyboard shortcuts in dwm are very handy).
					</p>
					<p>
						After some more time with Pop!_OS, I realized that I
						really missed Arch so I decided to try some other Arch
						based distros. With Garuda Linux, switchable graphics
						now works. Couldn't figure out how to get it working on
						vanilla arch. Integrated speakers didn't work out of the
						box, but was able to resolve it with the solution listed
						in the ArchWiki. Garuda linux implements a lot of the
						customizations I usually do in my vanilla Arch installs
						anyways (e.g. btrfs, zen kernel, chaotic-aur, backups w/
						timeshift, etc.), so I'm pretty happy with it. Ran into
						a bunch of crashing and system break issues with the
						GNOME edition. Timeshift usually helped me recover from
						this, but not always. Thus, decided to switch to KDE
						Dragonized edition as it looks nice, uses KDE plasma
						instead of GNOME, and comes with a bunch of gaming
						related apps pre-installed, which saves me time. Still
						encountered freezing issues with KDE Dragonized edition,
						so eventually switched to i3 edition, but replaced i3 w/
						Xmonad. Then replaced Xmonad w/ dwm-flexipatch.
						Performance is amazing and haven't encountered the
						freezing issue that I had with GNOME and KDE any more.

					<h2><a name="pros-and-cons">Pros and Cons</a></h2>

					<h3>Pros</h3>
					<ul>
						<li>
							The display is really good, I am highly satisfied
							with it. Everything is just so much smoother in
							144Hz.
						</li>
						<li>
							Keyboard is pretty good, maybe not as good as my old
							HP Spectre x360 which was excellent. Having a number
							pad on a 15" laptop is really good too.
						</li>
						<li>
							Gaming performance is amazing! Recently got Yakuza:
							Like a Dragon on Steam. Runs at above 60 fps on all
							of the highest settings.
						</li>
						<li>
							Love the keyboard backlighting and color changing on
							the fly. Would love to be able to customize this
							further in software though.
						</li>
						<li>
							Trackpad is the best I have used in a long time.
							Love the surface feel, my finger just glides.
						</li>
						<li>
							It was a bit more difficult than I expected to
							remove the bottom plate when upgrading the RAM and
							storage, but overall a very easy process. Really
							appreciate the focus on upgradeability in the
							hardware design.
						</li>
						<li>Tons of ports! Extremely useful!</li>
						<li>
							General build quality is solid. Really like the
							feel.
						</li>
					</ul>

					<h3>Cons</h3>
					<ul>
						<li>
							Speakers are really sub-par. I understand that
							System76 doesn't design the hardware, but this was
							my main disappointment. I have bluetooth bookshelf
							speakers and bluetooth headphones I can use, so this
							isn't an unsolvable problem, but just generally
							annoying.
						</li>
						<li>
							Webcam is functional, but not good at all.
							Definitely need to use an external webcam for video
							calls.
						</li>
						<li>
							The microphone has a strange oscillatory behavior
							where there is some buzzing sound that increases and
							decreases regularly. Additionally, you can really
							hear the fans ramping up and down in the mic, makes
							it difficult to have a meeting if you use the
							integrated mic and the fans suddenly turn on.
							Definitely need an external mic.
						</li>
						<li>
							Battery life is really bad when the discrete
							graphics card is on (as expected). Maybe a little
							more than an hour a time, sometimes more depending
							on how willing I am to lower CPU frequency and
							stuff. As a desktop replacement, that is to be
							expected through.
						</li>
						<li>
							Mouse click buttons are not great. Regularly left
							click on something in GNOME and nothing happens.
							"Tapping" with the mousepad works very reliably
							though.
						</li>
						<li>
							Fans can get really loud when gaming, but this is an
							understandable limitation with gaming laptops. I was
							able to mostly solve this by switching to a custom
							kernel.
						</li>
						<li>
							Random freezing is kind of an issue, but is
							generally resolved by using a custom kernel.
						</li>
					</ul>

					<h2><a name="conclusions">Conclusions</a></h2>
					<p>
						It may seem that the cons outweigh the pros, but this is
						only in number and I am really nitpicking. The things
						this laptop get right (e.g. gaming, refresh rate,
						switchable graphics, general performance) are much more
						important to me than the other things. Regarding price,
						you are definitely paying a premium for first-class
						linux support, but it is well worth it in my opinion. I
						do not want to use Windows anymore and I am happy to pay
						extra if it means supporting a company that promotes and
						sells Linux computers.
