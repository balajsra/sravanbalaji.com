            I ended up purchasing the Oryx Pro 7 with base memory and storage,
            then upgraded these components with parts I bought from Amazon. The
            upgrade experience was pretty good. Removing the bottom cover just
            involves removing a bunch of screws, nothing too difficult. I had a
            little trouble with this because one of the screws seemed to get
            stuck, but I eventually got it out. The

          </h2>
          <p>
            Regarding OS, I initially tried to install Arch Linux with dwm like
            I had on my desktop, but found that switching between the graphics
            modes (i.e. Integrated, Hybrid, and Discrete) was just a nightmare.
            I tried installing
            <a
              href="https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/system76-power/"
              target="_blank"
              >System76 software through the AUR</a
            >, but could never get it working reliably. Additionally, the laptop
            speakers did not seem to work out of the box. I eventually got the
            audio working thanks to the
            <a
              href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/System76_Oryx_Pro#Audio"
              target="_blank"
              >solution in the ArchWiki</a
            >, but I ultimately decided to switch to Pop!_OS because of the
            graphics switching issue. The main change I made to the default
            Pop!_OS install process was to use
            <a
              href="https://btrfs.wiki.kernel.org/index.php/Main_Page"
              target="_blank"
              >btrfs</a
            >
            rather than the default (ext4) so I could take snapshots and backup
            my data with
            <a href="https://github.com/teejee2008/timeshift" target="_blank"
              >Timeshift</a
            >.
          </p>
          <p>
            My experience with Pop!_OS was very positive. I'm really happy that
            System76 and Pop!_OS have come up with a good solution for
            switchable graphics. Being able to just click on the option in the
            GNOME menu is so useful. The window management in Pop!_OS's
            <a href="https://github.com/pop-os/cosmic" target="_blank"
              >COSMIC</a
            >
            desktop environment is very good too. Coming from a standalone
            tiling window manager like dwm, this provides a pretty good balance
            between convenience and usability.
          </p>
          <p>
            After some more time with Pop!_OS, I realized that I really missed
            the package management, customizability, and rolling release of
            Arch. Since I couldn't get Arch working before, I decided to try
            some other Arch based distros like
            <a href="https://manjaro.org/" target="_blank">Manjaro</a>
            and
            <a href="https://garudalinux.org/" target="_blank">Garuda</a>. With
            both of these, I found that switchable graphics (via the
            <a
              href="https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/system76-power/"
              target="_blank"
              >system76-power AUR package</a
            >), now works. I eventually decided on Garuda because it implements
            a lot of the customizations I usually do in my vanilla Arch installs
            anyways (e.g., btrfs, zen kernel, chaotic-aur, backups w/ timeshift,
            easy options to enable gaming tweaks, etc.).
          </p>
          <p>
            I started with the
            <a href="https://www.gnome.org/" target="_blank">GNOME</a>
            edition since I was used to it from Pop!_OS. Unfortunately, I
            immediately ran into crashing and system break issues. This led me
            to try the KDE Dragonized edition because it looks pretty nice and
            uses
            <a href="https://kde.org/plasma-desktop/" target="_blank"
              >KDE plasma</a
            >
            instead of GNOME. After running KDE for a while, I felt like I
            wanted something that is more easily customizable and lightweight. I
            decided to dive into the realm of standalone window managers with
            the
            <a href="https://i3wm.org/" target="_blank">i3</a>
            edition, but replaced i3 with
            <a href="https://xmonad.org/" target="_blank">Xmonad</a>
            because I was experimenting with it at the time. After realizing
            that Xmonad would not really fit my needs (mainly gaming), I
            replaced it with
            <a href="https://github.com/bakkeby/dwm-flexipatch" target="_blank"
              >dwm-flexipatch</a
            >. Now, performance is amazing and I absolutely love the keyboard
            based workflow I have configured.

          <p>
            One major complaint I had with the laptop was the loud fan noise and
            random application freezing. After some experimentation and
            searching, I finally found a solution. Switching to the performance
            profile using
            <a href="https://github.com/pop-os/system76-power" target="_blank"
              >system76-power</a
            >
            immediately resolved both issues. Just run
            <code> sudo system76-power profile performance </code> in a terminal
            or use
            <a
              href="https://github.com/pop-os/gnome-shell-extension-system76-power"

            if you are running GNOME.
          </p>

            I also found that using a custom kernel improved general system
            performance and thermals. I'm currently using the

            kernel with PDS scheduler which is available as a pre-compiled

          <h2><a name="pros-and-cons">Pros and Cons</a></h2>

          <h3>Pros</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>
              The display is really good, I am highly satisfied with it.
              Everything is just so much smoother in 144Hz.
            </li>
            <li>
              Keyboard is not bad at all, but it definitely doesn't match up in
              terms of quality and satisfaction to the excellent HP Spectre x360
              keyboard that I used previously. I really don't mind it though and
              love that it includes a full sized number pad. The layout doesn't
              feel cramped and it has plenty of keys that can be customized via
              the
              <a

                target="_blank"
                >keyboard configurator</a
              >.
            </li>
            <li>
              Gaming performance is amazing! I can run Yakuza: Like a Dragon at
              around 70 or 80 fps with all the settings turned up to the max. I
              love that I can use my favorite operating system without having to
              compromise too much on gaming performance.
            </li>
            <li>
              Love the keyboard backlighting and color changing on the fly.
              Would love to be able to customize this further in software
              though.
            </li>
            <li>
              When I need a mouse, I tend to use an external one, but the
              trackpad feels excellent to me. My finger just glides across the
              super smooth surface. I think the overall trackpad size is good as
              well. Not as large as one you would find on a Macbook, but
              definitely good enough for my use cases.
            </li>
            <li>
              It was a bit more difficult than I expected to remove the bottom
              plate when upgrading the RAM and storage, but overall a very easy
              process. Really appreciate the focus on upgradeability in the
              hardware design.
            </li>
            <li>
              I absolutely love the port selection. No need to live the dongle
              life when the laptop has so many built-in already.
            </li>
            <li>
              The build quality is pretty solid. It definitely feels like a
              premium device.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Cons</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Speakers are really sub-par. I understand that System76 doesn't
              design the hardware, but this was my main disappointment. I have
              bluetooth bookshelf speakers and bluetooth headphones I can use,
              so this isn't an unsolvable problem, but just generally annoying.
            </li>
            <li>
              Webcam is functional, but not good at all. Definitely need to use
              an external webcam for video calls.
            </li>
            <li>
              The microphone has a strange oscillatory behavior where there is
              some buzzing sound that increases and decreases regularly.
              Additionally, you can really hear the fans ramping up and down in
              the mic, makes it difficult to have a meeting if you use the
              integrated mic and the fans suddenly turn on. Definitely need an
              external mic.
            </li>
            <li>
              Battery life is really bad when the discrete graphics card is on
              (as expected). Maybe a little more than an hour a time, sometimes
              more depending on how willing I am to lower CPU frequency and
              stuff. As a desktop replacement type laptop, that is to be
              expected through.
            </li>
            <li>
              Fans can get really loud at times, especially when pushing the GPU
              in games. I often have to turn up my speakers or wear noise
              cancelling headphones. This is an understandable physical
              limitation of thin and light gaming laptops though.
            </li>
            <li>
              While the display itself is great, I really wish the hinge would
              rotate farther back. It looks like the screen can only rotate
              about 120 degrees from fully closed, so getting a good viewing
              angle (especially when the laptop is propped up or really low) can
              be difficult.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <hr />

          <h2><a name="conclusions">Conclusions</a></h2>
          <p>
            It may seem that the cons outweigh the pros, but this is only
            because I am really nitpicking. The things this laptop gets right
            (e.g., gaming, refresh rate, switchable graphics, general
            performance) are much more important to me than the other things
            (e.g., mic / webcam quality). Regarding price, you are definitely
            paying a premium for first-class linux support, but it is well worth
            it in my opinion. I do not want to use Windows anymore and I am
            happy to pay extra if it means supporting a company that promotes
            and sells Linux computers and having a device that can be easily
            upgraded down the line. Overall, I am very happy with my purchase.
