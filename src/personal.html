            <p>
              I have recently been trying Emacs because I have heard it is
              highly configurable and has amazing features like
              <a href="https://orgmode.org/" target="_blank">Org Mode</a> and
              <a href="https://magit.vc/" target="_blank">Magit</a>. My initial
              impression was that it was extremely difficult to use due to its
              unintuitive design and high reliance on keybindings. After
              watching some videos by
              <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/SystemCrafters" target="_blank"
                >System Crafters</a
              >, I slowly picked up on these keybindings and how to go about
              configuring emacs to my liking. I especially liked the
              <a

                >Emacs from Scratch</a
              >
              series which helped me build up my
              <a href="https://github.com/balajsra/emacs" target="_blank"
                >personal emacs configuration</a
              >. I have been using this configuration for a couple months, but I
              have come to realize that there are just too many missing features
              and issues that I kept having to find resolutions for.
            </p>
            <p>
              This is why I decided to switch to
              <a href="https://github.com/hlissner/doom-emacs" target="_blank"
                >Doom Emacs</a
              >, which is a distribution of Emacs that comes pre-configured with
              stability, performance, and vim keybindings in mind. The

              provides a good introduction to Doom Emacs in video form. My
              experience with Doom so far has been great. It works a lot more
              like what I expected my personal Emacs configuration to be, but is
              much easier to use and configure. Startup time is significantly
              faster, editing files is faster, vim-like keybindings are already
              setup, and it is functional out of the box. You can checkout my
              Doom Emacs configuration on

                >Chemacs 2</a
              >
              to easily switch between my personal and Doom configurations so I
              can compare and make improvements.

              Visual Studio Code is one of my favorite text editors. I have
              previously tried
              <a href="https://www.sublimetext.com/" target="_blank"
                >Sublime Text</a
              >,
              <a href="https://notepad-plus-plus.org/" target="_blank"
                >Notepad++</a
              >, and
              <a href="https://www.vim.org/" target="_blank">Vim</a>
              , but I was never fully satisfied with their functionality. When I
              first started using VS Code, I wasn't convinced by it either. It
              looked like just another text editor with no special features.
              Over time, Microsoft has done a great job of improving stability,
              speed, and functionality. The feature that finally made the
              decision for me was the community support for extensions. If you
              are a die hard Vim user for example, there's a Vim emulation
              extension that should ease the transition. I just love the overall
              aesthetic, auto-completion, and sheer number of features
              available. It runs on every platform you could conceivably develop
              on and it looks great! Check out some of my favorite extensions
              and customization options below.

              This is my current favorite productivity app. I use it to keep

              shopping lists, personal wish lists, upcoming video games, etc. I

              <a href="https://keep.google.com/" target="_blank">Google Keep</a>
              to track tasks and random bits of information, but Notion has been
              a game changer. While the full experience is locked behind a
              paywall, you can get the paid tier for free if you have a
              university (.edu) email. If you haven't already, I would suggest
              giving it a try. Use this

              use any of the paid tiers.

              Have you ever wondered if there was an app to combine all of your
              messaging apps into 1? Well, Ferdi is the answer. I used to keep
              multiple tabs and programs open so I could see all of my messaging
              services at once, but with Ferdi, they are all neatly packaged in
              one application. Any messaging service with a web app can be
              accessed through Ferdi. Give it a try, I'm sure you will enjoy it
              as much as I do. The best part, it's free and open source!

              This is my preferred Podcast app. I have it on my Android phone
              and on my Arch Linux desktop and laptop. I purchased the web app
              and android app prior to the new

                >subscription</a

              for those who previously purchased the web version. While I'm not
              a big fan of subscription models (especially when they previously
              didn't exist), I appreciate that they have implemented a free tier
              that has the majority of features that most people will need.

              After trying

              finally decided to go with Vivaldi. It will be very familiar for
              those coming from Chrome since it is also based on
              <a href="https://www.chromium.org/" target="_blank">Chromium</a>.
              The main reason I like it is for its customizability. There are so
              many features available to the user like tab stacking and tiling
              that I find extremely helpful. If you are a browser power user
              such as myself, I think you will find it really hard to switch to
              another browser's tab management system. Vivaldi's is by the best
              I have used. Additionally, most if not all Chrome extensions can
              be used with Vivaldi and it has built-in ad blocking and tracking
              prevention. Definitely recommend that you give it a try.

              I'm a big fan of free and open source software. This is especially
              important with messenger apps where user privacy is very
              important. Signal uses the same end-to-end encryption protocol
              (Signal Protocol) as WhatsApp, but without the

                >Facebook tracking</a
              >. This means it is incredibly difficult to intercept and decode
              messages sent through Signal. Since Signal is an independent
              nonprofit, they are not tied to any major tech company and they
              cannot be acquired by one in the future. They are entirely funded
              by donations and grants. If you are looking to move away from
              messenger services like WhatsApp and Facebook Messenger, Signal is
              the best option.

            <p>
              I was looking for a Linux laptop that I could use for development,
              general productivity, and gaming over the next couple of years.
              While I love my desktop and my ultrabook laptop, I really wanted
              one device that could fill both roles. After doing some research,
              I landed on
              <a href="https://system76.com" target="_blank">System76</a>. They
              are a U.S. based company that specializes in selling Linux
              laptops, desktops, and servers. They also make their own Linux
              distribution in

              their available laptops, the

                >Oryx Pro</a
              >
              lineup seemed to be the best balance of portability, power, and
              hybrid graphics. The last point is especially important to me
              because I want to be able to extend battery life by turning off
              the discrete GPU when I don't need it. Overall, I am very happy
              with my purchase. For more information, check out my

            <h2>Tablet: Microsoft Surface Go</h2>
            <p>
              I primarily use the Surface Go as a secondary-device and tablet. I
              use it for media consumption, occasional textbook / pdf reading,
              and for taking digital handwritten notes with the

              you do end up going with the Surface Go, make sure you

              to be able to install apps that aren't on the Microsoft Store. I
              would generally recommend looking for bundles as the type cover
              and pen are not included by default.

              I did experiment with running
              <a href="https://blissos.org" target="_blank">BlissOS</a>
              on this tablet since I really like the hardware, but I'm not the
              biggest fan of Windows. After a bit of configuration, it was
              definitely usable, but had some deal breaking issues. The first
              one being battery drain. It seemed like the battery life was much
              lower than I would have expected and I didn't find a good way to
              resolve this. The other big issue I found was with the on-board
              speakers. When listening to music or watching a video, the audio
              seemingly played at 1/2 the normal speed. When connecting
              headphones to the headphone jack, it had the same issue. However,
              audio worked perfectly when connecting headphones over Bluetooth.

            <p>
              Got the Galaxy S10+ on sale on Amazon's Prime Day. My previous
              phone was a Pixel 2XL which I really liked, but I decided to
              switch to a Galaxy after the Pixel 3 was a bit of a disappointment
              and the Pixel 4 wouldn't come out until later in the year. Other
              phones I considered, but ultimately decided against were the
              OnePlus 7 Pro and Samsung Galaxy Note 9. In retrospect, I would
              have waited to replace my Pixel 2XL until the Galaxy Note 10+ came
              out and the price dropped down to something reasonable. However, I
              am happy with my decision as is.

            <h2>Watch: Samsung Galaxy Watch</h2>
            <p>
              I previously had a Moto 360 Sport smartwatch, but the performance
              was extremely disappointing. After looking at other Android wear
              devices, I didn't feel that another compelling watch on the level
              of the Apple Watch for iPhones existed. Thus, I decided to switch
              to the Galaxy watch. My primary impressions of Tizen OS vs Android
              Wear is the lack of supported apps. I have found that this really
              isn't that big of a deal as it has great media controls for your
              phone and the amazing rotating bezel interface. This is by far the
              superior input method for watches and I feel that all watches
              should have some variant of this. Overall, the performance is
              great and I have come to appreciate Samsung's brand of apps for my
              phone and watch.

              I found these on sale at Costco and heard that the audio quality
              was among the best for the price. I love that they also have audio
              passthrough so you can hear your environment when necessary, or
              keep noise cancelling on. They fit nice in my ears and don't fall
              out. Additionally, they integrate well with my Galaxy Watch and
              Galaxy S10+. My only gripes are that the mic isn't that great for
              taking phone calls and the battery life is not great. Samsung
              reports 6 hours of charge in the earbuds and 7 hours in the case.
              In my experience, this is pretty accurate. Don't expect long,
              continuous music sessions.

            <h2>Wireless Headphones: Sony WH-1000XM4</h2>
            <p>
              I previously purchased the WH-1000XM2's, but decided to upgrade
              after seeing the XM4's on sale. The XM4's are an improvement in
              every way and well worth the price. Sound quality is amazing,
              noise cancelling is excellent, and it has audio passthrough in
              case you need to hear your environment. If you need wireless
              bluetooth headphones, this is it. My favorite feature is
              definitely the ability to connect to two devices (e.g. laptop and
              phone) at once. This means I can answer a call on my phone while
              listening to music on my laptop without having to completely
              re-pair devices. I also really like the battery life. Sony reports
              30 hours of charge. If you will be away from an outlet for an
              extended period of time and plan on using your headphones a lot,
              these are great.

            <h2>Favorite Games</h2>
            <p>
              These are a couple of my all-time favorite video games (of the
              ones I have played), organized by platform. I haven't necessarily
              completed all of them, but these are the ones that I enjoyed the
              most or found the most memorable. Some cross-platform games that I
              previously played on other systems, like Xbox 360, have since been
              re-purchased on PC. I have listed these cross-platform games under
              PC (even if played elsewhere) since this is currently my primary
              gaming platform.
            </p>
            <p>
              From the platforms listed below, you may be wondering about some
              notable omissions like The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild,
              Bloodborne, God of War, Fallout: New Vegas, Portal 2, etc. While I
              do own these and have played them, I never really got past the
              first few hours for one reason or another. I do intend to return
              to these (at least the ones available on PC) when I find time and
              will update this list accordingly.

              reveal how they're navigating an ever-changing landscape, what

              As an aspiring roboticist, I'm very interested in the state of the
              art in artificial intelligence, machine learning, and robotics.
              The Lex Fridman podcast is a series of conversations with
              prominent members in the field of AI, science, and technology at
              MIT and in industry.

              The premise of Throughline is exploring how we can look at the
              past to understand the present. The hosts are awesome and always
              find very interesting stories in the past relating to current
              events that help put things in perspective.

              The Vergecast is perhaps my favorite podcast of any genre. The
              hosts discuss the week's tech news and other nerdy topics as well
              as interviews with tech leaders. Cannot recommend this enough.

              This is my favorite news/comedy podcast. I love hearing about the
              week's wacky stories and the rotating panel of comedians' opinions
              on world events.
