							Visual Studio Code is currently my favorite editor
							for most programming applications I work on. I have
							previously tried
							<a
								href="https://www.sublimetext.com/"
								target="_blank"
								>Sublime Text</a
							>,
							<a
								href="https://notepad-plus-plus.org/"
								target="_blank"
								>Notepad++</a
							>, and
							<a href="https://www.vim.org/" target="_blank"
								>Vim</a
							>
							as my primary text editors, but I was never fully
							satisfied with their functionality. When I first
							started using VS Code, I wasn't convinced by it
							either. It looked like just another text editor with
							no special features. Over time, Microsoft has done a
							great job of improving stability, speed, and
							functionality. The feature that finally made the
							decision for me was the community support for
							extensions. If you are a die hard Vim user for
							example, there's a Vim emulation extension that
							should ease the transition. I just love the overall
							aesthetic, auto-completion, and sheer number of
							features available. It runs on every platform you
							could conceivably develop on and it looks great!
							Don't plan on switching editors any time soon! Check
							out some of my favorite extensions and customization
							options below. If you are using
							<a

							Fences is a desktop management software that allows

						<p>
							I wasn't actually interested in Start10 when I first

							that it allows you to customize the way your taskbar
							looks and the style of start menu you would like.
							The options are Windows 7, Windows 10, or Modern.
							Windows 7 has the classic search bar and list of
							applications. Windows 10 has the list of programs
							and start menu <i>tiles</i> introduced in Windows
							10. Modern style is a bit of a hybrid. It has the
							application list from Windows 7, but the theme looks
							more like Windows 10. I personally prefer Windows 10
							style because of the <i>tiles</i> that easily let
							you launch your favorite apps. I wouldn't
							necessarily recommend getting Start10 on its own as
							I don't see much value in it, but it is a nice
							addition if you have ever wanted to change the look
							of your taskbar or start menu.

							reduced RAM usage. I haven't done any official tests

							more responsive. Additionally, most if not all
							Chrome extensions can be used on the new Edge, so
							that should help ease the transition for those who
							can't live without them. One of Microsoft's main
							selling points for the new Edge is privacy features.
							Overall, there are still a few issues I have
							encountered like links in google searches not
							opening properly, but I can put up with that for the
							performance improvement. Finally, you will want to

							be paired with Chrome OS. One feature I wished I had
							on Windows + Android was the ability to unlock the
							Pixelbook with an Android Phone. With this app, you
							can do just that. You'll need the

						<h2>Laptop: HP Spectre x360 15"</h2>
						<p>
							My laptop is mainly used for school. I wanted a
							touchscreen so I could take digital written notes in
							class and I needed a good processor and dedicated
							graphics card for
							<abbr title="Computer Aided Design">CAD</abbr>
							software and for general programming applications. I
							landed on the HP Spectre x360 because it had a great
							balance of specs, amazing display, touch screen, and
							very nice typing experience for a reasonable price.
							I was initially leaning towards a Razer Blade or
							Microsoft's Surface Book. The former would be great
							for school and for gaming, but it isn't great for
							taking handwritten digital notes. The latter is
							similar to the Spectre in regards to specs, but has
							a favorable display ratio. The main reason I chose
							against it in the end was the high price relative to
							the Spectre. I was able to get very comparable specs
							for a much lower price with the Spectre. My laptop
							is the 2016 model with Intel i7-7500U CPU, NVIDIA
							GeForce 940MX GPU, and 16 GB RAM. The newer models
							have thinner bezels, diamond-cut corners, updated
							specs, and better trackpad drivers. I got around
							this issue by

							apps. I have found that this really isn't that big
							of a deal as it has great media controls for your
							phone and the amazing rotating bezel interface. This
							is by far the superior input method for watches and
							I feel that all watches should have some variant of
							this. Overall, the performance is great and I have
							come to appreciate Samsung's brand of apps for my

							noise cancelling on. They fit nice in my ears and
							don't fall out. My only grip is that the mic isn't
							that great for taking phone calls. Integrates well
							with my Galaxy Watch and Galaxy S10+. My one grip is
							the battery life. Samsung reports 6 hours of charge
							in the earbuds and 7 hours in the case. In my

							in every way and well worth the price. Sound quality
							is amazing, noise cancelling is excellent, and it

							<a
