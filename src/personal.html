            <p>
              I have recently been trying Emacs because I have heard it is
              highly configurable and has amazing features like
              <a href="https://orgmode.org/" target="_blank">Org Mode</a> and
              <a href="https://magit.vc/" target="_blank">Magit</a>. My initial
              impression was that it was extremely difficult to use due to its
              unintuitive design and high reliance on keybindings. After
              watching some videos by
              <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/SystemCrafters" target="_blank"
                >System Crafters</a
              >, I slowly picked up on these keybindings and how to go about
              configuring emacs to my liking. I especially liked the
              <a

                >Emacs from Scratch</a
              >
              series which helped me build up my
              <a href="https://github.com/balajsra/emacs" target="_blank"
                >personal emacs configuration</a
              >. I have been using this configuration for a couple months, but I
              have come to realize that there are just too many missing features
              and issues that I kept having to find resolutions for.
            </p>
            <p>
              This is why I decided to switch to
              <a href="https://github.com/hlissner/doom-emacs" target="_blank"
                >Doom Emacs</a
              >, which is a distribution of Emacs that comes pre-configured with
              stability, performance, and vim keybindings in mind. The

              provides a good introduction to Doom Emacs in video form. My
              experience with Doom so far has been great. It works a lot more
              like what I expected my personal Emacs configuration to be, but is
              much easier to use and configure. Startup time is significantly
              faster, editing files is faster, vim-like keybindings are already
              setup, and it is functional out of the box. You can checkout my
              Doom Emacs configuration on

                >Chemacs 2</a
              >
              to easily switch between my personal and Doom configurations so I
              can compare and make improvements.

              Visual Studio Code is one of my favorite text editors. I have
              previously tried
              <a href="https://www.sublimetext.com/" target="_blank"
                >Sublime Text</a
              >,
              <a href="https://notepad-plus-plus.org/" target="_blank"
                >Notepad++</a
              >, and
              <a href="https://www.vim.org/" target="_blank">Vim</a>
              , but I was never fully satisfied with their functionality. When I
              first started using VS Code, I wasn't convinced by it either. It
              looked like just another text editor with no special features.
              Over time, Microsoft has done a great job of improving stability,
              speed, and functionality. The feature that finally made the
              decision for me was the community support for extensions. If you
              are a die hard Vim user for example, there's a Vim emulation
              extension that should ease the transition. I just love the overall
              aesthetic, auto-completion, and sheer number of features
              available. It runs on every platform you could conceivably develop
              on and it looks great! Check out some of my favorite extensions
              and customization options below.

              This is my current favorite productivity app. I use it to keep
              track of things like homework, personal tasks, gift ideas,
              shopping lists, personal wish lists, upcoming video games, etc. I
              previously used
              <a href="https://trello.com/en-US" target="_blank">Trello</a>
              and
              <a href="https://keep.google.com/" target="_blank">Google Keep</a>
              to track tasks and random bits of information, but Notion has been
              a game changer. While the full experience is locked behind a
              paywall, you can get the paid tier for free if you have a
              university (.edu) email. If you haven't already, I would suggest
              giving it a try. Use this
              <a

                >referral link</a

              use any of the paid tiers.

              Have you ever wondered if there was an app to combine all of your
              messaging apps into 1? Well, Ferdium is the answer. I used to keep
              multiple tabs and programs open so I could see all of my messaging
              services at once, but with Ferdium, they are all neatly packaged
              in one application. Any messaging service with a web app can be
              accessed through Ferdium. Give it a try, I'm sure you will enjoy
              it as much as I do. The best part, it's free and open source!

              This is my preferred Podcast app. I have it on my Android phone

              for those who previously purchased the web version. While I'm not
              a big fan of subscription models (especially when they previously
              didn't exist), I appreciate that they have implemented a free tier
              that has the majority of features that most people will need.

              After trying
              <a href="https://www.google.com/chrome/" target="_blank"
                >Google Chrome</a
              >,

                >Microsoft Edge</a
              >, and <a href="https://brave.com/" target="_blank">Brave</a>, I
              finally decided to go with Vivaldi. It will be very familiar for
              those coming from Chrome since it is also based on
              <a href="https://www.chromium.org/" target="_blank">Chromium</a>.
              The main reason I like it is for its customizability. There are so
              many features available to the user like tab stacking and tiling
              that I find extremely helpful. If you are a browser power user
              such as myself, I think you will find it really hard to switch to
              another browser's tab management system. Vivaldi's is by the best
              I have used. Additionally, most if not all Chrome extensions can
              be used with Vivaldi and it has built-in ad blocking and tracking
              prevention. Definitely recommend that you give it a try.

              I'm a big fan of free and open source software. This is especially
              important with messenger apps where user privacy is very
              important. Signal uses the same end-to-end encryption protocol
              (Signal Protocol) as WhatsApp, but without the

                target="_blank"
                >Facebook tracking</a
              >. This means it is incredibly difficult to intercept and decode
              messages sent through Signal. Since Signal is an independent
              nonprofit, they are not tied to any major tech company and they
              cannot be acquired by one in the future. They are entirely funded
              by donations and grants. If you are looking to move away from
              messenger services like WhatsApp and Facebook Messenger, Signal is
              the best option.

              The most important feature of password managers is security.
              Bitwarden is open source, which means the source code, features,
              and infrastructure security are vetted and improved by a global
              community of cybersecurity experts. Additionally, all information
              stored in Bitwarden is end-to-end encrypted, so you can trust it
              with sensitive data like banking passwords, social security
              numbers, etc. I especially love that it offers its core features
              free for personal use, is available on all major platforms
              (including Linux), and can sync across devices. If you aren't
              using a password manager and don't want to pay a monthly or yearly
              subscription, I highly suggest that you give this a look.

              Lutris (along with Steam) is my favorite software when it comes to
              Linux gaming. Per their website, "Lutris is an Open Source gaming
              platform for Linux. It installs and launches games so you can
              start playing without the hassle of setting up your games. Get
              your games from GOG, Steam, Battle.net, Origin, Uplay and many
              other sources running on any Linux powered gaming machine." It
              allows me to manage and run all of my games (including emulated
              games) in one place where I can customize environment variables,
              pre and post launch scripts, custom version of wine, etc. If you
              want to get the most out of Linux gaming, especially for non-steam
              games, Lutris is a must-have.

            <p>
              I was looking for a Linux laptop that I could use for development,
              general productivity, and gaming over the next couple of years.
              While I love my desktop and my ultrabook laptop, I really wanted
              one device that could fill both roles. After doing some research,
              I landed on
              <a href="https://system76.com" target="_blank">System76</a>. They
              are a U.S. based company that specializes in selling Linux
              laptops, desktops, and servers. They also make their own Linux
              distribution in

              lineup seemed to be the best balance of portability, power, and
              hybrid graphics. The last point is especially important to me
              because I want to be able to extend battery life by turning off
              the discrete GPU when I don't need it. Overall, I am very happy
              with my purchase. For more information, check out my

            <h2>Phone: Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 4</h2>
            <p>
              I was originally really hesitant about getting a folding phone
              given some of the quality control issues with the early
              generations of the Galaxy Z Fold, but the 4th is really where
              Samsung refined their design to the point that I think it is ready
              for the mainstream. I upgraded to this from a Galaxy S10+, which I
              absolutely loved. However, this device is a step above even the
              top of the line slab style phones. The versatility of having an
              almost full size phone when folded, and an amazing tablet when
              unfolded is unmatched by the competition (at least in the U.S.
              market). Multi tasking and content consumption on the big screen
              is absolutely amazing. No longer do I need to pull out a big and
              clunky tablet (like the Microsoft Surface Go I had before) to
              watch a movie. Now, I just pull out my phone and unfold it into a
              screen that is plenty big enough to watch whatever I want.
              Sometimes, I even watch a live sports match while multi-tasking
              with stats on a second app. This kind of functionality will
              definitely cost you, but given that it can replace two devices,
              can fit in your pocket, and supports the S-pen, I can absolutely
              recommend this device for anyone looking to upgrade to a folding
              phone.

            <p>
              With the Samsung Galaxy Watch 5 Pro (and some older devices),
              Samsung partnered with Google to build a new version of Wear OS.
              Now, you get the amazing user experience from Samsung's old Tizen
              OS with all the app support of Google's Wear OS. The Watch 5 Pro
              drops the mechanical bezel that I loved on my old Galaxy Watch,
              but the capacitive bezel is perfectly fine. Battery live is
              decent, but nothing special in my experience. I can usually get a
              little more than a full day's worth of battery even with the
              always on display activated. It charges pretty quickly though, so
              I've never had an issue as long as I charge it for a bit every
              morning before leaving for the day. If you're an Android phone
              user, I can absolutely recommend this device. Especially if you
              have a samsung phone.

              Upgraded to the Galaxy Buds 2 Pro along with the Galaxy Watch 5
              Pro when I bought the Z Fold 4 as a part of a bundle. I was
              running into battery issues with my old Galaxy Buds, so these have
              been a welcome improvement. Audio quality is good enough for my
              needs, but nothing special considering the physical limitations of
              in-ear bud style audio products. Haven't had any issue with
              battery life as I generally don't use them long enough to burn
              through the entire battery. Even if you do, you can pop them back
              into the case which will charge them. Haven't done any significant
              testing with mic quality, but haven't had issues taking calls on
              them. I love that they come with noise cancelling and audio
              passthrough, so you can hear your surroundings when walking around
              outside and block out the noise when working.

              I previously purchased the WH-1000XM2's, but decided to upgrade
              after seeing the XM4's on sale. The XM4's are an improvement in
              every way and well worth the price. Sound quality is amazing,
              noise cancelling is excellent, and it has audio passthrough in
              case you need to hear your environment. If you need wireless
              bluetooth headphones, this is it. My favorite feature is
              definitely the ability to connect to two devices (e.g. laptop and
              phone) at once. This means I can answer a call on my phone while
              listening to music on my laptop without having to completely
              disconnect and reconnect. If you want to use the better sounding
              LDAC codec, you will only be able to connect to one device at a
              time. This is a worth while tradeoff in my opinion considering how
              much better everything sounds. I also really like the battery
              life. Sony reports 30 hours of charge. If you will be away from an
              outlet for an extended period of time and plan on using your
              headphones a lot, these are great.

              controls (e.g., volume knob), hot swappable switches, and keymapping software that works
              on Linux. After some searching, I came across the Keychron Q1 Pro,
              which is the wireless version of the much loved Keychron Q1. I
              haven't really tried any mechanical switches before, so I went
              with
              <a
                href="https://www.keychron.com/products/gateron-cap-switch-set?variant=40119285284953"
                target="_blank"
                >Gateron Browns</a
              >
              which have a tactile bump, but aren't too loud. These are quiet
              enough to be used in an office setting or during a call while
              still being satisfying to type on. The switches definitely aren't
              as clicky as my old Razer Huntsman Elite, which I see as a plus.
              It takes a little bit of getting used to, but I absolutely love
              them now. For the keycaps, I went with
              <a
                href="https://www.keychron.com/products/cherry-profile-double-shot-pbt-full-set-keycaps-player"
                target="_blank"
                >Cherry Profile Double-Shot PBT Full Set Keycaps - Player</a
              >
              from Keychron. These look absolutely amazing (in my opinion), but
              I'm sure I'll look into other sets when they come back in stock in
              the future. I also love that this is a 75% keyboard. It has just
              enough keys for some special functions I use on my computer and
              gives me a bunch of desk space back.

            <h2>Favorite Games</h2>
            <p>
              These are a couple of my all-time favorite video games (of the
              ones I have played), organized by platform. I haven't necessarily
              completed all of them, but these are the ones that I enjoyed the
              most or found the most memorable. Some cross-platform games that I
              previously played on other systems, like Xbox 360, have since been
              re-purchased on PC. I have listed these cross-platform games under
              PC (even if played elsewhere) since this is currently my primary
              gaming platform.
            </p>
            <p>
              From the platforms listed below, you may be wondering about some
              notable omissions like The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild,
              Bloodborne, God of War, Fallout: New Vegas, Portal 2, etc. While I
              do own these and have played them, I never really got past the
              first few hours for one reason or another. I do intend to return
              to these (at least the ones available on PC) when I find time and
              will update this list accordingly.
            </p>

              I have started using

              track my video game collection as it has a nice interface, is
              free, has metadata for tons of games (across multiple platforms),
              and has great social features. You can check out

              This is a podcast about big ideas and other problems. Verge
              editor-in-chief Nilay Patel talks to a diverse cast of innovators
              and policy makers on the frontiers of business and technology to
              reveal how they're navigating an ever-changing landscape, what
              keeps them up at night, and what it all means for our shared
              future. This is one of my favorite interview style podcasts
              because Nilay does a great job of asking tough questions of his
              interviewees and explaining complex things in an easy to
              understand way.

              really piqued my interest in motorsport. As I started to follow
              the 2021 F1 season more intently (especially the dramatic and
              controversial finale in Abu Dhabi), I found the Missed Apex F1
              podcast. The hosts are very entertaining and provide detailed
              analysis and opinions of each race and the season as a whole. If
              you are interested in following F1, I definitely recommend
              checking this podcast out.
