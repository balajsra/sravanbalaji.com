							Visual Studio Code is currently my favorite editor
							for most programming applications I work on. I have
							previously tried
							<a

								target="_blank"
								>Sublime Text</a
							>,
							<a
								href="https://notepad-plus-plus.org/"
								target="_blank"
								>Notepad++</a
							>, and
							<a href="https://www.vim.org/" target="_blank"
								>Vim</a
							>
							as my primary text editors, but I was never fully
							satisfied with their functionality. When I first
							started using VS Code, I wasn't convinced by it
							either. It looked like just another text editor with
							no special features. Over time, Microsoft has done a
							great job of improving stability, speed, and
							functionality. The feature that finally made the
							decision for me was the community support for
							extensions. If you are a die hard Vim user for
							example, there's a Vim emulation extension that
							should ease the transition. I just love the overall
							aesthetic, auto-completion, and sheer number of
							features available. It runs on every platform you
							could conceivably develop on and it looks great!
							Don't plan on switching editors any time soon! Check
							out some of my favorite extensions and customization
							options below.

							experience is locked behind a paywall, you can get
							the paid tier for free if you have a university
							(.edu) email. If you haven't already, I would
							suggest giving it a try. Use this

						<h2>Laptop: HP Spectre x360 15"</h2>
						<p>
							My laptop is mainly used for school. I wanted a
							touchscreen so I could take digital written notes in
							class and I needed a good processor and dedicated
							graphics card for
							<abbr title="Computer Aided Design">CAD</abbr>
							software and for general programming applications. I
							landed on the HP Spectre x360 because it had a great
							balance of specs, amazing display, touch screen, and
							very nice typing experience for a reasonable price.
							I was initially leaning towards a Razer Blade or
							Microsoft's Surface Book. The former would be great
							for school and for gaming, but it isn't great for
							taking handwritten digital notes. The latter is
							similar to the Spectre in regards to specs, but has
							a favorable display ratio for productivity. The main
							reason I chose against the Surface Book in the end
							was the high price relative to the Spectre. I was
							able to get very comparable specs for a much lower
							price with the Spectre. My laptop is the 2016 model
							with Intel i7-7500U CPU, NVIDIA GeForce 940MX GPU,
							and 16 GB RAM. The newer models have thinner bezels,
							diamond-cut corners, updated specs, and better
							trackpad drivers. If you are running Windows 10 and
							want better touch pad drivers, check out

							. Finally, I have had many issues with the speakers
							on my model. This has been reported by many other

							resolved on newer models, but it's something to look
							out for.

							phone and the amazing rotating bezel interface. This
							is by far the superior input method for watches and
							I feel that all watches should have some variant of
