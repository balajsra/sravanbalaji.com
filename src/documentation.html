							My idea for this website started simply as a way for
							me to present my professional portfolio. As I
							started learning HTML and looking at other websites
							for inspiration, I decided to make it my own and add
							in the personal page with some of my recommendations
							and favorite things. Additionally, I noticed that
							very few people had any documentation on how/where
							they learned web design. While git repos were
							generally made public, it was hard for someone to
							understand what was going on if they weren't already
							familiar with the framework or language being used.
							Thus, I decided to create a documentation page which
							will hopefully help others who are interested in
							making their own website do so using what I have
							learned from friends I have talked to. It also helps
							me save some useful links in a way that others can
							see and understand the use case for.
						</p>

						<p>
							This website was originally designed in HTML with
							some CSS for styling. However, I ran into issues
							with scalability and mobile browser support. See
							<a href="#web_design">Web Design</a> below for my
							current implementation method and some other cool
							things that I have discovered through my learning
							process that you may find interesting.

						<h2>Purchasing a Domain Name</h2>
						<p>
							Per
							<a href="https://vesikar.com/" target="_blank"
								>Yash Vesikar</a
							>'s recommendation, I used
							<a
								href="https://domains.google.com/"
								target="_blank"
								>Google Domains</a
							>
							to purchase the
							<a href="https://sravanbalaji.com/"
								>sravanbalaji.com</a

						<h2>Hosting Website</h2>
						<p>
							There are a couple of options I have found for
							hosting my website (for free). As a U of M student,
							I am able to create my own UM Web Page hosted on U
							of M Servers or create a personal site hosted by
							Google through the
							<a href="http://google.umich.edu/" target="_blank"
								>U-M Google collaboration</a
							>. I have not looked into the Google Sites option,
							but there is
							<a
								href="https://support.google.com/sites/"
								target="_blank"
								>documentation</a
							>
							available if you are interested. I originally opted
							to create my own site and host it on U of M Servers.
							Information on how to do this can be found on the
							<a
								href="http://www.umich.edu/~umweb/how-to/homepage.html"
								target="_blank"
								>UMICH Information and Technology Services
								website</a
							>. Some limitations I found with this were that I
							would have to manually upload my website files to
							the afs directory as the SFTP process described did
							not work for me. Additionally, the domain name for U
							of M hosted websites take the form
							<b>http://www-personal.umich.edu/~youruniqname/</b>
							which is clearly not ideal. You can sort of get
							around this by enabling
							<a
								href="https://support.google.com/domains/answer/4522141?hl=en"
								target="_blank"
								>web forwarding</a
							>
							on Google Domains. All this does is redirect traffic
							from your custom domain to the U of M domain. This
							might be ok for you, but I would prefer to have my
							website show up at the domain I purchased. Per
							<a href="https://vesikar.com/" target="_blank"
								>Yash Vesikar</a
							>'s recommendation, I looked into
							<a href="https://pages.github.com/" target="_blank"
								>GitHub Pages</a
							>
							to host my website directly from a GitHub
							repository. This comes with the added benefit that
							changes are live as soon as you push them to the
							<b>master</b> branch of your
							<b>&lt;username&gt;.github.io</b>
							repository. I found
							<a
								href="https://trentyang.com/how-to-setup-google-domain-for-github-pages/"
								target="_blank"
								>Trent Yang's post</a
							>
							about setting up Google Domains for GitHub pages
							very useful.

						<h2>Bootstrap Framework</h2>
						<p>
							When I first made this website, it was implemented
							in HTML and CSS without the use of a framework. This
							gave me a lot of custom control over every aspect,
							but it made some things unnecessarily tedious and
							difficult. One example of this is the navigation
							bar. Trying to implement that without a framework is
							more difficult than it needs to be. Another issue I
							ran into was compatibility with mobile browsers. Per
							<a
								href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/tianhongwen/"
								target="_blank"
								>Tianhong (Sam) Wen</a
							>'s recommendation, I looked into
							<a href="https://getbootstrap.com/" target="_blank"
								>Bootstrap</a
							>. This has built-in <i>responsive</i> classes that
							can auto adjust the size and placement of elements
							based on the screen size. It also provides an easy
							way to implement some cool features like the navbar,
							accordion-like cards, and a grid layout to easily
							place images and text around your website's
							viewport.

						<h2>Reusing HTML</h2>
						<p>
							The easiest way I found to reuse HTML code is via
							JavaScript as described in
							<a
								href="https://www.uvm.edu/~bnelson/computer/javascript/pageheadersandfooters.html"
								target="_blank"
								>Page Headers And Footers</a
							>. This is by no means the most elegant or
							automated, but it was the only method I could get to
							actually work. If you don't want to go through the
							hassle of manually removing line breaks, you can use
							this handy online text converter from
							<a
								href="https://www.textfixer.com/tools/remove-line-breaks.php"
								target="_blank"
								>Text Fixer</a
							>.

						<h2>Display Resume PDF in Website using GitHub</h2>
						<p>
							I have the latest version of my
							<a href="./portfolio.html#resume">resume</a> stored
							in a public
							<a
								href="https://github.com/balajsra/resume"
								target="_blank"
							>
								GitHub repository</a
							>, but I wanted an easy way to share it directly on
							my website. This led me to look for ways to embed a
							PDF in HTML. This works great for local files, but
							not so great for PDFs stored in a repository. The
							trick is to get the link to the raw PDF file from
							GitHub and to use Google Drive PDF Viewer. This is
							outlined in
