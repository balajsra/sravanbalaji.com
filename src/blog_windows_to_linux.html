					<h2><a name="introduction">Introduction</a></h2>
					<p>
						Around the summer of 2020, I started experimenting with
						Linux to see if it could replace Windows as my daily
						driver operating system. I had a little bit of
						experience with
						<a
							href="https://www.redhat.com/en/technologies/linux-platforms/enterprise-linux"
							target="_blank"
							>Red Hat Enterprise Linux</a
						>
						and
						<a href="https://ubuntu.com" target="_blank">Ubuntu</a>
						through my Computer Science course work, but I had never
						really used it as my daily driver desktop / laptop
						operating system. I really wanted to see if it could
						handle development, general productivity, and gaming.
					</p>

					<h3>Development</h3>
					<p>
						Development is definitely where Linux shines because of
						its superior package management. For example, Ubuntu
						(and its derivatives) use the apt package manager which
						allows you to easily install most development packages
						like Python, gcc, Git, etc. On Windows, you have to go
						to a website, click on a download link, run an
						executable, and walk through the steps in an installer.
						On Linux, it is as simple as a couple terminal commands.
						There's a reason even Microsoft felt it needed to
						improve the developer experience on Windows via the
						<a
							href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10"
							target="_blank"
							>Windows Subsystem for Linux</a
						>.
					</p>

					<h3>Productivity</h3>
					<p>
						General productivity is no different on Linux than
						Windows, other than the lack of Microsoft Office and
						some proprietary software like Adobe's products. This
						wasn't a big deal for me because there are plenty of
						free and open-source alternatives as well as web-based
						options if I ever needed to write documents, create
						presentations, edit pictures, etc. If you rely on
						software that only works on Windows for daily
						productivity work, you might want to look into free and
						open-source alternatives before switching to Linux.
					</p>

					<h3>Gaming</h3>
					<p>
						Gaming was really the main concern I had when thinking
						about moving away from Windows. Luckily, there has been
						a lot of progress on this front in recent years. Per
						<a href="https://www.protondb.com" target="_blank"
							>ProtonDB</a
						>:
					</p>
					<blockquote cite="https://www.protondb.com">
						"Proton is a new tool released by Valve Software that
						has been integrated with Steam Play to make playing
						Windows games on Linux as simple as hitting the Play
						button within Steam. Underneath the hood, Proton
						comprises other popular tools like Wine and DXVK among
						others that a gamer would otherwise have to install and
						maintain themselves. This greatly eases the burden for
						users to switch to Linux without having to learn the
						underlying systems or losing access to a large part of
						their library of games. Proton is still in its infancy
						so support is inconsistent, but regularly improving."
					</blockquote>
					<p>
						Looking at ProtonDB, a lot of the games I play (mostly
						single-player) have gold or above ratings, meaning they
						generally work by just pressing the play button,
						possibly with a few tweaks. After trying this out
						myself, I have come to the same conclusion. Gaming on
						Linux is as good as it has ever been and will only get
						better, especially after the announcement and release of
						the Linux powered
						<a
							href="https://store.steampowered.com/steamdeck"
							target="_blank"
							>Steam Deck</a
						>
						from Valve. If you play a lot of online multiplayer
						games, you may need to wait as popular anti-cheat
						software doesn't currently work through Proton.

					<h2><a name="distro-hopping">Distro Hopping</a></h2>
					<p>
						After trying out a bunch of distros like
						<a href="https://ubuntu.com" target="_blank">Ubuntu</a>,
						<a href="https://pop.system76.com" target="_blank"
							>Pop!_OS</a
						>, and
						<a href="https://getfedora.org" target="_blank"
							>Fedora</a
						>, I eventually landed on
						<a href="https://archlinux.org" target="_blank"
							>Arch Linux</a
						>. As someone who likes to tinker with their computer a
						lot, Arch felt like the best option because I could
						literally build my OS from the ground up. I essentially
						have complete control over which packages get installed
						on my system. This means there is a steep learning curve
						and things can break if you are not careful, but the
						<a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org" target="_blank"
							>ArchWiki</a
						>
						is possibly the greatest Linux resource I have ever
						seen. The main reasons I decided on Arch are:
					</p>
					<ul>
						<li>
							<b>Rolling Release</b>: I don't have to re-install
							my OS every 6 months. My system and the kernel get
							updated through my package manager.
						</li>
						<li>
							<b>Package Management</b>: Pacman and AUR helpers
							(e.g.
							<a
								href="https://github.com/Morganamilo/paru"
								target="_blank"
								>paru</a
							>) are by far the best package management solution I
							have seen in Linux. Pretty much any piece of
							software you might want to use is available in
							either the
							<a
								href="https://archlinux.org/packages/"
								target="_blank"
								>main Arch repos</a
							>
							or the
							<a href="https://aur.archlinux.org" target="_blank"
								>AUR</a
							>. I wanted my packages to be up to date without
							relying on universal package formats like
							<a href="https://snapcraft.io" target="_blank"
								>snap</a
							>, <a href="flathub" target="_blank">flatpak</a>, or
							<a href="https://appimage.org" target="_blank"
								>AppImage</a
							>. While these are great in that they can run on any
							Linux distro, they don't integrate into the system
							as well as I would like. AppImages have to be
							updated manually and don't integrate well with the
							desktop experience by default. Flatpaks are
							sandboxed applications, which means they require
							manual intervention to access certain parts of the
							OS. The main issue I found here was with theming.
							For lots of open source applications, they may not
							have a snap, flatpak, or AppImage package, but they
							almost always have an AUR package. This means it is
							extremely rare to have to manually install any
							application or program on my system.
						</li>
						<li>
							<b>Customizability</b>: Everything on my system was
							either installed by me or a dependency for something
							I installed. There is little to no bloatware.
						</li>
					</ul>
					<p>
						After running Arch on my gaming desktop and ultrabook
						laptop for around a year, I decided to buy a Linux
						gaming laptop. I wanted to have one system that I could
						get work done and play games on. After doing some
						research, I landed on the
						<a
							href="https://system76.com/laptops/oryx"
							target="_blank"
							>System76 Oryx Pro 7</a
						>
						because it is made by a U.S. based company with
						excellent customer service and has first-class Linux
						support. System76 also makes Pop!_OS, which I tried for
						a couple of weeks, but I just had to go back to Arch for
						the reasons mentioned above. Luckily, the ArchWiki has a
						<a
							href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/System76_Oryx_Pro"
							target="_blank"
							>page for the System76 Oryx Pro</a
						>. Unfortunately, I had some issue with NVIDIA's Linux
						drivers and
						<a
							href="https://github.com/pop-os/system76-power"
							target="_blank"
							>System76's graphics switching tool</a
						>
						on Arch. I was able to resolve the issue by switching to
						<a href="https://garudalinux.org" target="_blank"
							>Garuda Linux</a
						>, which is based on Arch, but provides an easy to use
						installer and some nice GUI tools for configuring your
						system. As of the time of writing, I don't see myself
						switching from Garuda because it provides all the
						benefits of Arch without the initial hassle of
						installing the system from scratch.

					<h2>
						<a name="desktop-environments">Desktop Environments</a>
					</h2>
					<p>
						While I was in the process of switching between Linux
						distros, I was also switching between desktop
						environments. I was most familiar with
						<a href="https://www.gnome.org" target="_blank"
							>GNOME</a
						>
						from Ubuntu and Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL), but it
						felt kind of slow and lacked customizability. This is
						when I discovered
						<a href="https://kde.org" target="_blank">KDE Plasma</a
						>. Coming from Windows, I was much more comfortable with
						the look and feel of KDE Plasma. Additionally, it has
						many (perhaps too many) customizability options. After
						using this for a while, I eventually ran into some
						system freezing issues that I didn't expect to see given
						my hardware and felt that I could go for something a bit
						more minimal.
					</p>

					<h2><a name="window-managers">Window Managers</a></h2>
					<p>
						This is when I learned about window managers from
						YouTubers like
						<a
							href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCVls1GmFKf6WlTraIb_IaJg"
							target="_blank"
							>DistroTube</a
						>. Desktop environments are generally a combination of a
						window manager and a bunch of utility programs and
						pre-installed apps. A standalone window manager just
						controls where windows show up on your screen and the
						decorations that appear around them. The most suggested
						window manager for beginners is generally
						<a href="https://i3wm.org" target="_blank">i3</a>. This
						is a tiling window manager with a configuration file
						that is written in an easy to use syntax. I tried i3 for
						a while, but it never really stuck, so I went back to
						KDE Plasma. After doing some more research, I eventually
						landed on
						<a href="https://dwm.suckless.org" target="_blank"
							>dwm</a
						>. Given my experience with C/C++, this seemed like a
						better window manager for my needs. One of the main
						downsides of dwm is that it is meant to be super minimal
						where features you might expect to see need to be added
						through patches. The process of patching can be slow,
						annoying, and prone to error. One solution, that I ended
						up going with, is to use
						<a
							href="https://github.com/bakkeby/dwm-flexipatch"
							target="_blank"
							>dwm-flexipatch</a
						>. This includes a bunch of commonly used patches that
						can be enabled or disabled very easily. You can see my
						configuration of dwm-flexipatch on
						<a
							href="https://github.com/balajsra/dwm-flexipatch"
							target="_blank"
							>GitHub</a
						>.
