            Welcome to my personal website! This started out as a side project
            to learn about web development and UI design, but it has since
            expanded into a professional portfolio and blog (sort of). If you
            are a fan of dark mode, try out the toggle button in the upper right
            corner!

            <br /><br />

            On this website, you can find information about my
            <a href="./portfolio.html#education">educational</a> and
            <a href="./portfolio.html#professional_experience"
              >professional career</a
            >
            as well as some of my
            <a href="./personal.html">personal interests</a>. If you are looking
            to create your own website and are curious about how I created and
            hosted this one, please see the
            <a href="./documentation.html">documentation</a>
            page.

            <br /><br />

            This website is a constant work in progress and updates will be made
            as I find time. You can follow development and make suggestions on
