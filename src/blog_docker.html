					<h2><a name="introduction">Introduction</a></h2>
					<p>
						Throughout my college career in computer science, I have
						found the need to develop applications that will be
						deployed in a Linux environment. As a windows user, I
						have usually turned to a couple of different options:
						virtual machines,
						<a
							href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/about"
							target="_blank"
							>Windows Subsystem for Linux</a
						>, or
						<a href="https://www.cygwin.com" target="_blank"
							>Cygwin</a
						>. Recently, I discovered an alternative method for
						building and testing Linux apps that is especially
						useful for collaboration and deployment. Docker allows
						you to package an OS and all the necessary dependencies
						into a <b>docker image</b>. You can then spin up an
						instance of this image called a
						<b>docker container</b> in which you can run your source
						code. Jake Wright's video was incredibly helpful in my
						understanding of what docker is, how it's different from
						virtual machines, and how to use it.

					<h2><a name="installing_docker">Installing Docker</a></h2>
					<p>
						Depending on your host machine's operating system, you
						will install one of the following Docker products. If
						you have macOS or Windows, your first option should be
						Docker Desktop. Check if you meet the system
						requirements. If you do not, Docker Toolbox is the
						legacy option that uses Oracle VirtualBox rather than
						Hyper-V or HyperKit for virtualization. I am using a
						computer with Windows 10 Home, so I use Docker Toolbox
						for Windows. This blog post will discuss some solutions
						to edge-case issues with Docker Toolbox that Docker
						Desktop users will hopefully not have to deal with.

					<h3>Docker Toolbox & WSL</h3>
					<p>
						As mentioned previously, I am using Docker Toolbox since
						Windows 10 Home does not support Hyper-V for
						virtualization with Docker Desktop. You can run docker
						toolbox in a command prompt or powershell terminal, but
						I personally prefer to use WSL because I am more
						familiar with bash terminal commands. If you are
						interested in this setup, continue reading this section.
						Otherwise, you can skip ahead.
					</p>

					<h4>Installing WSL</h4>
					<p>
						The default way to install WSL is through the
						<a
							href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/about"
							target="_blank"
							>Microsoft Store</a
						>. This will install WSL on your system drive (e.g.
						C:\). If you are like me and don't want to install it on
						your system drive, follow the instructions
						<a
							href="https://kontext.tech/column/tools/308/how-to-install-windows-subsystem-for-linux-on-a-non-c-drive"
							target="_blank"
							>here</a
						>.
					</p>

					<h4>Setting Up Docker Toolbox with WSL</h4>
					<p>
						After installing WSL, follow the instructions in
						<a
							href="https://medium.com/@joaoh82/setting-up-docker-toolbox-for-windows-home-10-and-wsl-to-work-perfectly-2fd34ed41d51"
							target="_blank"
							>Setting Up Docker Toolbox for Windows Home 10 and
							WSL to Work Perfectly!</a
						>
						starting with
						<b>Install Docker and Docker Compose within WSL</b>. As
						you will have seen near the end of that post, there are
						some extra steps needed to ensure that volume mounts
						work. After setting <code>root = /</code>, you will need
						to configure shared folders for the
						<code>default</code> docker machine in VirtualBox.
					</p>

					<h4>Shared Folder Configuration for Volume Mounting</h4>
					<p>
						I configured all of my drives as shared folders so I can
						mount any folders on my host machine to any docker
						containers I run. In your WSL terminal, run
						<code>docker-machine.exe start</code> to start the
						<code>default</code> docker machine created by the
						Docker Quickstart Terminal. After your docker machine is
						running, open the shared folder settings as shown in
						<a
							href="https://medium.com/@Charles_Stover/fixing-volumes-in-docker-toolbox-4ad5ace0e572"
							target="_blank"
							>Fixing Volumes in Docker Toolbox</a
						>. The image below shows how <code>C:\</code> on my host
						computer is mounted at <code>/</code> in folder
						<code>c</code> on my docker machine such that
						<code>C:\</code> maps to <code>/c</code>. Make sure you
						have enabled <code>Auto-mount</code> and
						<code>Make Permanent</code>. Click <b>OK</b> to save all
						settings, then go back to the WSL terminal and run
						<code>docker-machine.exe restart default</code>. Now
						your docker machine should be properly configured to
						allow volume mounting.
					</p>

					<h4>Increase Docker Machine Resources</h4>
					<p>
						One issue I ran into with the default settings for the
						<code>default</code> docker machine is the amount of RAM
						allocated to it. I attempted to build the
						<a
							href="https://github.com/borglab/gtsam"
							target="_blank"
							>GTSAM</a
						>
						library inside a docker container and ran into an
						<i>internal compiler error: Killed (program cc1plus)</i
						>. As mentioned
						<a
							href="https://github.com/docker/for-win/issues/403"
							target="_blank"
							>here</a
						>, the solution is to increase the RAM allocated to the
						docker machine in VirtualBox. In the WSL terminal, run
						<code>docker-machine.exe stop</code> to shutdown the
						docker machine. When this is complete, right click on
						the <code>default</code> docker machine in VirtualBox
						and open <b>Settings</b>. In the <b>System</b> tab,
						increase <i>Base Memory</i>. Similar to virtual
						machines, I would not recommend allocating more than
						half of your system's RAM. For example, my computer has
						16 GB of RAM, so I would only recommend allocating up to
						8 GB of RAM to the docker machine. You can look through
						the other options, such as number of allocated processor
						cores, as well if you wish.

							>X Forwarding for GUI Applications</a
						>
					</h2>
					<p>
						In a virtual machine, you can easily run GUI
						applications such as a web browser, text editor, etc. In
						a docker container, the process is a little bit
						different. You will need to download an X Server such as
						<a
							href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/vcxsrv/"
							target="_blank"
							>VcXsrv Windows X Server</a
						>.

							target="_blank"
							>Run GUI app in linux docker container on windows
							host</a
						>
						provides a great explanation of why you would want to do
						this and how to run your docker container. The post
						discusses how to set your IP address as the
						<code>DISPLAY</code> environment variable that is passed
						to docker via the
						<code>-e DISPLAY=$DISPLAY</code> command line argument.
						You can alternatively pass your IP address as an
						environment variable in your docker compose file. This
						is shown in
						<a
							href="https://github.com/MAAV-Software/ros-tutorial"
							target="_blank"
							>MAAV's ROS Tutorial</a
						>
						(reproduced below). The main settings to look at below
						are <code>environment</code> and
						<code>network_mode</code>. Set the
						<code>DISPLAY</code> environment variable to
						<code>[ip_address]:0.0</code> and set
						<code>network_mode: "host"</code>.
					</p>
					<pre>
                        <code class="yml">
# docker-compose.yml
version: "2"

services:
ros-demo:
    image: ros-demo
    privileged: true
    volumes:
    # Mount the current directory do everything in /tutorial within docker
    - .:/tutorial:rw
    environment:
    - DISPLAY=1.1.1.1:0.0 # Change 1.1.1.1 to your IP Address
    network_mode: "host"
    container_name: ros-demo
    command: "/bin/bash --init-file scripts/source-ros.sh" #source ros automatically
                        </code>
