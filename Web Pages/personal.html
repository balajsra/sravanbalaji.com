                        <p>
                            Fences is a desktop management software that allows you to group your desktop icons into "fences".
                            These fences can be rolled up so they are tucked away neatly into a corner, allowing you to view
                            your desktop wallpaper while still being able to access your shortcuts when you need to.
                            I really like Fences because it keeps my desktop clutter-free and I get to look at my amazing
                            wallpaper (see <a href="#Wallpaper Engine">Wallpaper Engine</a>). I purchased Fences on
                            <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/607380/Fences/" target="_blank">Steam</a>, but you
                            can also get it directly from <a href="https://www.stardock.com/products/fences/" target="_blank">Stardock's website</a>.
                            Would definitely recommend getting it if you have a cluttered desktop.

                        <h3>Platform: Windows</h3>
                        <p>
                            I wasn't actually interested in Start10 when I first got it. I got it in a bundle with <a href="#Fences">Fences</a>.
                            The gist of Start10 is that it allows you to customize the way your taskbar looks and the style of start menu
                            you would like. The options are Windows 7, Windows 10, or Modern. Windows 7 has the classic
                            searchbar and list of applications. Windows 10 has the list of programs and start menu "tiles"
                            introduced in Windows 10. Modern style is a bit of a hybrid. It has the application list from
                            Windows 7, but the theme looks more like Windows 10. I personally prefer Windows 10 style because
                            of the "tiles" that easily let you launch your favorite apps. I wouldn't necessarily recommend
                            getting Start10 on its own as I don't see much value in it, but it is a nice addition if you have
                            ever wanted to change the look of your taskbar or start menu.

                        <p>
                            Wallpaper Engine is amongst my favorite programs on this list. If you have ever seen live wallpapers on phones
                            and thought "can I get that on my <abbr title="Personal Computer">PC</abbr>?", this is the program for you. At a regular price of $3.99, I
                            cannot recommend this enough. Fair warning, this will drain your battery and <abbr title="Random Access Memory">RAM</abbr> if you plan on running
                            it at its highest settings with animations and other compute heavy settings. I usually run this on my laptop
                            so the wallpaper is static when unplugged, but animated and reactive when plugged in. There are some memory
                            saving options that can pause the program when another program is in full-screen and in-focus to improve
                            battery life and performance.

                            This is my current favorite productivity app. I use it to keep track of things like homework, personal tasks,
                            gift ideas, shopping lists, personal wish lists, upcoming video games, etc. I previously used
                            <a href="https://trello.com/en-US" target="_blank">Trello</a> and <a href="https://keep.google.com/" target="_blank">Google Keep</a>
                            to track tasks and random bits of information, but Notion has been a game changer. While the
                            full experience is locked behind a paywall, you can get the paid tier for free if you have a university (.edu) email.
                            If you haven't already, I would suggest giving it a try. Use this
                            <a href="https://www.notion.so/?r=542c7e5df78d4ff0bf5417dd397f26b8" target="_blank">referral link</a> to get
                            some free credit on your account to use if you decide to use any of the paid tiers.

                            Have you ever wondered if there was an app to combine all of your messaging apps into 1? Well, Clatter
                            is the answer. I used to keep multiple tabs and programs open so I could see all of my messaging services
                            at once, but with Clatter, they are all neatly packaged in one application. Any messaging service with a web
                            app can be accessed through Clatter. Give it a try, I'm sure you will enjoy it as much as I do.

                            Chocolatey is Windows's answer to Homebrew. It is essentially a package manager that allows you to easily track
                            and upgrade/install/uninstall programs on Windows. My process when installing apps is to check if there is a
                            Windows app on the Microsoft Store. If not, I check Chocolatey. More times than not, it's available there.
                            You can easily install any programs you need via command prompt and avoid the tedious installation wizard.

                            (tip 29). All relevant information on what apps to download and a fix for a login issue can be found in the
                            reddit post. The gist of the app is that it removes ads from YouTube on your android phone and you can play
                            music while your screen is off for free.

                        <p>
                            At the time of writing, Microsoft Edge (Chromium) doesn't have an official release yet. Latest reports suggest January 15th, 2020 as the official release
                            date. You can still download a Beta, Development, or Canary build of the new web browser from the <a href="https://www.microsoftedgeinsider.com/en-us/" target="_blank">Edge Insider site</a>.
                            I have been using the development build of the new Microsoft Edge since around June 2019 and have generally enjoyed it.
                            It will be very familiar for those coming from Chrome since it is also based on <a href="https://www.chromium.org/" target="_blank">Chromium</a>.
                            The main reason I like it is for its speed and reduced <abbr title="Random Access Memory">RAM</abbr> usage. I haven't done any official tests comparing performance, but it
                            subjectively seems more responsive. Additionally, most if not all Chrome extensions can be used on the new Edge, so that
                            should help ease the transition for those who can't live without them. One of Microsoft's main selling points for
                            the new Edge is privacy features. Overall, there are still a few issues I have encountered like links in google searches
                            not opening properly, but I'm sure these will be ironed out by the official release date.

                            supported on all android devices, but it works with my Samsung Galaxy S10+. The main feature I use is viewing my

                        <p>
                            I discovered Remote Fingerprint Unlock recently, but in my short time with it, I absolutely love it. When Google announced the
                            <a href="https://store.google.com/us/product/google_pixelbook" target="_blank">Pixelbook</a> back in 2017, needless to say I was
                            very disappointed to hear that the great hardware would be paired with Chrome <abbr title="Operating System">OS</abbr>. One feature I wished I had on Windows + Android
                            was the ability to unlock the Pixelbook with an Android Phone. With this app, you can do just that. You'll need the
                            <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=ro.andreimircius.remotefingerauth&hl=en_US" target="_blank">Android App</a>
                            and the <a href="http://bit.ly/2Q4YoUP" target="_blank">Windows Program</a>. If you get the Pro version, you can even use the
                            Wake-on-<abbr title="Local-Area Network">LAN</abbr> feature.

                        <p>
                            My laptop is mainly used for school. I wanted a touchscreen so I could take digital written notes in class and
                            I needed a good processor and dedicated graphics card for <abbr title="Computer Aided Design">CAD</abbr> software and for general programming applications.
                            I landed on the HP Spectre x360 because it had a great balance of specs, amazing display, touch screen, and very
                            nice typing experience for a reasonable price. I was initially leaning towards a Razer Blade or Microsoft's Surface
                            Book. The former would be great for school and for gaming, but it isn't great for taking handwritten digital notes.
                            The latter is similar to the Spectre in regards to specs, but has a favorable display ratio. The main reason I chose
                            against it in the end was the high price relative to the Spectre. I was able to get very comparable specs for a much
                            lower price with the Spectre. My laptop is the 2016 model with Intel i7-7500U <abbr title="Central Processing Unit">CPU</abbr>, NVIDIA GeForce 940MX <abbr title="Graphics Processing Unit">GPU</abbr>, and
                            16 <abbr title="Gigabyte">GB</abbr> <abbr title="Random Access Memory">RAM</abbr>. The newer models have thinner bezels, diamond-cut corners, updated specs, and better trackpad drivers.
                            I got around this issue by <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/how-enable-precision-touchpad-drivers" target="_blank">
                            installing Microsoft's Precision Trackpad drivers</a> myself as the pre-installed Synaptics drivers are trash.

                            reading. It is by no means powerful enough to act as my primary device, but I like it as a secondary device that
                            I will occasionally use. If you do end up going with the Surface Go, make sure you

                            Got the Galaxy S10+ on sale on Amazon's Prime Day. My previous phone was a Pixel 2XL which I really liked, but I decided
                            to switch to a Galaxy after the Pixel 3 was a bit of a disappointment and the Pixel 4 wouldn't come out until later in the year.
                            Other phones I considered, but ultimately decided against were the OnePlus 7 Pro and Samsung Galaxy Note 9. In retrospect,
                            I would have waited to replace my Pixel 2XL until the Galaxy Note 10+ came out and the price dropped down to something reasonable.
                            However, I am happy with my decision as is.

                            I previously had a Moto 360 Sport smartwatch, but the performance was extremely disappointing. After looking at other
                            Android wear devices, I didn't feel that another compelling watch on the level of the Apple Watch for iPhones existed.
                            Thus, I decided to switch to the Galaxy watch. My primary impressions of Tizen <abbr title="Operating System">OS</abbr> vs Android Wear is the lack of
                            supported apps. I have found that this really isn't that big of a deal as it has great media controls for your phone
                            and the amazing rotating bezel interface. This is by far the superior input method for watches and I feel that
                            all watches should have some variant of this. Overall, the performance is great and I have come to appreciate
                            Samsung's brand of apps for my phone and watch.

                            I found these on sale at Costco and heard that the audio quality was among the best for the price. I love that they also have
                            audio passthrough so you can hear your environment when necessary, or keep noise cancelling on. They fit nice in my ears
                            and don't fall out. My only grip is that the mic isn't that great for taking phone calls. Integrates well with my Galaxy
                            Watch and Galaxy S10+. My one grip is the battery life. Samsum reports 6 hours of charge in the earbuds and 7 hours
                            in the case. In my experience, this is pretty accurate. Don't expect long, continuous music sessions.

                            I actually purchased the WH-1000XM2's before the XM3's came out, but the XM3's are an improvement in every way and
                            well worth the price. Sound quality is amazing, noise cancelling is excellent, and it has audio passthrough in case
                            you need to hear your environment. If you need wireless bluetooth headphones, this is it. You can get these headphones
                            for around $290 on <a href="https://drop.com/buy/sony-wh-1000xm3-wireless-noise-canceling-headphones/" target="_blank">Drop</a>.
                            My favorite feature is definitely the battery life. Sony reports 30 hours of charge. If you will be away from
                            an outlet for an extended period of time and plan on using your headphones a lot, these are great.

                        <p>
                            As a New England Patriot's fan (most because of Tom Brady), I really enjoy this (perhaps too Boston-centric) sports podcast.
                            Bill Simmons grew up in the New England area and supports all of the Boston teams, although he currently lives in Los Angeles.
                            I enjoy his conversations with friends and family about the week's events in sports, generally focused on <abbr title="National Football League">NFL</abbr> and <abbr title="National Basketball Association">NBA</abbr>.
                            He occasionally has celebrity guests and sometimes brings guests on to talk about TV and movies.

                            I love the light-hearted and sometimes comedic news and analysis of Premier League (and others) matches. The rotating
                            cast of football journalists and long-time hosts are thoroughly enjoyable to listen to every week.
                            Definitely recommend this podcast for any football (soccer) fans.

                        The Giant Bombcast is a great podcast for video game fans. They discuss video game news, latest releases, and sometimes
                        stuff completely unrelated. Very fun to listen to throughout the week as each episode is pretty long.

                            are generally 4 to 5 hours long and aren't released very often as they require an enormous amount of research.

                            I'm not entirely sure how to describe this podcast. According to the podcast description, Invisibilia is about
                            the unseeable forces that control human behavior and shake our ideas, beliefs, and assumptions. Definitely very
                            interesting and different from most of the other podcasts I listen to.
